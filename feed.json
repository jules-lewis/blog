You can see how the challenge works, and how we solved Step 1 <a href=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/hotelrooms-and-other-strange-places-2024.html\">at the start of the series</a>. </p><pre><code>SPOILER ALERT!\n\nIf you want to have a go at solving The SEINT&#39;s puzzle yourself, please DON&#39;T read on here, as this is obviously heavily spoilered. \n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"step-8\">Step 8</h4>\n<p>This puzzle was a lot of fun. We start off with this collage:</p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/step8.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"582\" height=\"582\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/step8-xs.jpg 300w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/step8-sm.jpg 480w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/step8-md.jpg 768w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/step8-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure><p><em>The Seint</em> then addes the following text:</p><blockquote>\n<p>I really love nature, animals, old architecture, but to be honest, I can also enjoy some European art! During my latest travels, I also visited a famous museum, where I was fortunate to view some lovely paintings, which were all on display, and took some awesome photos. But somehow, after I managed to create a collage of some of the paintings, I lost the original ones! Can you help me find the original painters? Just the first two letters of their real first names are enough for me to be reminded. Just collect the eight characters, convert them to lower case, put them in alphabetical order, and hash them. So let’s say all of them were painted by Vincent van Gogh, the first two letters are “vi”, and in alphabetical order, all eight would be: “iiiivvvv”. Got it? Off you go!</p></blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"google-lens\">Google Lens</h4>\n<p>Google Lens was a big help with some of these, but the bottom-right excerpt gave me a few problems. Just loading the unedited photo seems to indicate that Google evaluates images left-to-right, top-down. In any case, it identified the top left quadrant straightaway:</p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img src=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/oq24-34-top-left.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"708\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/oq24-34-top-left-xs.jpg 300w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/oq24-34-top-left-sm.jpg 480w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/oq24-34-top-left-md.jpg 768w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/oq24-34-top-left-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure><p>Google Lens has a built-in cropping tool that does let you focus in on other areas of the image though. This segment also resulted in a clue to which gallery <em>The Seint</em> was referring to:</p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/oq24-35-top-right.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"903\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/oq24-35-top-right-xs.jpg 300w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/oq24-35-top-right-sm.jpg 480w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/oq24-35-top-right-md.jpg 768w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/oq24-35-top-right-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure><p>This technique also got me the bottom-left segment, so with some further searches I had the following information:</p><ul>\n<li>top left: Leonardo da Vinci — Ginevra de Benci (1474)</li>\n<li>top-right: Peter Paul Rubens — The Portrait of Marchesa Brigida Spinola-Doria (1606)</li>\n<li>bottom-left: Antonio da Correggio — Salvator Mundi (1515)</li>\n<li>bottom-right: <em>???</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I then got a <em>lot</em> of false positives searching on the bottom-right segment. I had no idea of the variety of earrings there are out the in the world of art! I also got no obvious results from Bing or Yandex. </p><p>Eventually, I was able to move forward by actually cropping the original collage down to the bit I was interested in, and running it through TinEye:</p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img src=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/oq24-36-bottom-right.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"646\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/oq24-36-bottom-right-xs.jpg 300w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/oq24-36-bottom-right-sm.jpg 480w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/oq24-36-bottom-right-md.jpg 768w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/oq24-36-bottom-right-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure><p>One of the results was a little larger than 474x568, but not by much. In any case, it was enough to run back through the various search engines…</p><p>Google then confidently identifies the wrong painting, but hints at an artist that might need further searching:</p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/oq24-37-maes.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"566\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/oq24-37-maes-xs.jpg 300w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/oq24-37-maes-sm.jpg 480w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/oq24-37-maes-md.jpg 768w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/oq24-37-maes-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure><p>Clicking on that related search gives us a number of options, including a <strong><a href=\"https://www.nga.gov/collection/artist-info.1503.html#works\">page on the National Gallery of Art website</a></strong>. Worth checking, as this is the gallery showing the other works.</p><p>Sure enough, we have a hit on one of the first paintings (I had to zoom in to verify, but you can just about make it out here:</p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/oq24-38-portrait.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"434\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/oq24-38-portrait-xs.jpg 300w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/oq24-38-portrait-sm.jpg 480w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/oq24-38-portrait-md.jpg 768w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/oq24-38-portrait-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure><p>This completes our list, and gives us our letters:</p><ul>\n<li>top left: ==Le==onardo da Vinci — Ginevra de Benci (1474)</li>\n<li>top-right: ==Pe==ter Paul Rubens — The Portrait of Marchesa Brigida Spinola-Doria (1606)</li>\n<li>bottom-left: ==An==tonio da Correggio — Salvator Mundi (1515)</li>\n<li>bottom-right: ==Ni==colaes Maes — Portrait of a Lady (1676)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sorting these, turning them to lower-case, and hashing them was enough to get to Step 9!</p><hr>\n<p><em>Featured image credit: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:WalkwaytoWestBuildingandCascadeCafe.jpg\">Evelyn y, Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en\">CC BY-SA 4.0</a></em></p>",

What I wanted to let you know, is that for 94 years, with some small breaks, this city was very important transport wise! After 94 years, it was not a part of this whole adventure anymore.

The modes of transport quickly narrowed down to rail because commercial flight would not be around for a while, and airships didn’t last 94 years. We know we’re looking for a building where an adventurous journey on this mode of transport used to end. We also have some clues about the architect.</p><p>After several iterations, the following search got me what I needed: <code>terminus designed by german architect in 1890s</code></p><p>This got me to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirkeci_railway_station\">Sirceki railway station</a> in Istanbul, where the Orient Express used to end its journey. And the station’s architect was <em>August Jasmund</em>.</p><h3 id=\"ai-struggles-with-this-one\">AI struggles with this one.</h3>\n<p>Having solved the puzzle, I decide to see how the popular chatbots would get on. In each case, I helped out by removing the first half of the clue, the ‘digression’, and including the only valuable information that comes out of understanding the digression. Here’s the prompt I came up with:</p><pre><code>PROMPT\n\nI would like you to solve the following puzzle. Think step by step:\n\nWhat I wanted to let you know, is that [[from the 1890&#39;s and]] for 94 years, with some small breaks, this city was very important transport wise! After 94 years, it was not a part of this whole adventure anymore. The only thing keeping its memories are the buildings where the adventure used to end. The architect who designed the building was actually sent by the newly formed German empire for study, but he became the man who created this historically important building. \n</code></pre>\n<p>Here are the responses I got:</p><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>LLM</th>\n<th>Result</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Google Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental</td>\n<td>“Based on the clues provided, the city you are referring to is Berlin, and the historically important building is the Anhalter Bahnhof (Anhalter Station).” The tool correctly identified the architect of this building as Franz Heinrich Schwechten.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Claude 3.5 Sonnet</td>\n<td>“This puzzle appears to be describing the Haydarpaşa Terminal in Istanbul and its role in the Orient Express railway line.” Right city, right railway line, but wrong station. It gave the architects as Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Perplexity</td>\n<td>“The building mentioned is likely the Reichstag, designed by Paul Wallot and completed in 1894 … While the Reichstag itself wasn’t directly related to the transport system, it symbolizes the period of German unification and modernization that coincided with the development of Berlin’s transport infrastructure.”</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>OpenAI ChatGPT</td>\n<td>This description seems to match Helsinki Central Railway Station in Finland … The station was designed by Eliel Saarinen, a Finnish architect who studied abroad and had connections to Germany.”</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Oddly, Claude insisted Haydarpaşa Terminal was the eastern terminus of the Orient Express, but in fact you could only get to it by crossing the Bosphorus from Sirkeci Station.</p><p>Thinking about my own reasoning, I tried to improve the prompt by focusing on the word in The Seint’s clue that made the difference in identifying the correct railway line: “<em>adventure</em>“. The <em>Orient Express</em> definitely conjures up a sense of adventure, featuring in so much of European culture through the 20th century.</p><p>Simply adding the following into each model got them to the correct result:</p><pre><code>PROMPT\n\nThis is not correct, but focusing on the word adventure may improve your answer\n</code></pre>\n<p>In each case, prompting on that specific word was enough to get to the right answer, which probably explains why there’s such a lively industry around prompt engineering!</p><p>Anyway, we have <em>August Jasmund</em>, and that is enough to get our hash for <a href=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/hotelrooms-and-other-strange-places-2024-8.html\">Step 8</a>.</p><hr>\n<p><em>Featured image credit: The terminus of the Orient Express in Constantinople (Istanbul) around 1918, by Sébah &amp; Joaillier (Public domain).</em></p>",

The lyrics were in Spanish, but as I could understand some basic words, they were saying: “Let’s go on a trip to look for magical sounds”. What a wonderful phrase for our quest! Let’s look for the magical sounds in the country the song tells about. This country’s largest city’s website has a long history, as well as the telephone number for their office. The number has changed over the years, but can you find the telephone number of the municipality from 2010? </p><p>Make a hash of the number (written with pattern: XXX-XXXX, like: 123-4567) to uncover the next step.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Let’s start with the song. If the lyrics were in Spanish, then “Let’s go on a trip…” must be an English translation. Thankfully, Google Translate has improved tremendously over the years, so that going from one language to another and back doesn’t (usually) result in gibberish:</p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/4/oq24-20-google-translate.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/4/responsive/oq24-20-google-translate-xs.jpg 300w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/4/responsive/oq24-20-google-translate-sm.jpg 480w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/4/responsive/oq24-20-google-translate-md.jpg 768w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/4/responsive/oq24-20-google-translate-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure><p>Now let’s try searching for those lyrics. Simply searching <code>lyrics Vamos de viaje para buscar sonidos mágicos</code> results in several links to the lyrics of <em>Ecuador</em> by German DJ Sash! I’m going to save you a click and say that it isn’t a patch on <em>Encore une fois</em>.</p><p>Googling the largest city in Ecuador leads us to <em>Guayaquil</em>, the nation’s economic capital and main port. However, it’s not the official capital city, which is <em>Quito</em>. This feels like The Seint’s way of reminding OSINT practitioners that every word in a puzzle or investigation can be important.</p><p>Now we simply Google <code>Guayaquil website</code>, which leads us to <a href=\"https://www.guayaquil.gob.ec/\">https://www.guayaquil.gob.ec/</a>. Of course, we need to know how the site looked in 2010, so we’re off to the Wayback Machine.

One advantage of a CTF is that you absolutely know the perseverance will pay off; in a real investigation you can spend hours down a rabbit hole for no reward.</p><p>We start off with an image and a clue:</p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/3/oq24-10-scene.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/3/responsive/oq24-10-scene-xs.jpg 300w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/3/responsive/oq24-10-scene-sm.jpg 480w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/3/responsive/oq24-10-scene-md.jpg 768w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/3/responsive/oq24-10-scene-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure><blockquote>\n<p>My friend hasn’t written since the last time we spoke about snails on the Portuguese coast. I was a little concerned, so I wrote a quick message and asked if there was some kind of new adventure going on. The reply came almost instantly, but… As always, it wasn’t a normal message. It was just a photo with some hills and woods. So again, to know where my friend was travelling, I had to do a little search. Will you help me? Along with the photo, there was also a question - “<strong>what were the words written there, just right next to the snake, in the year of that animal?</strong>”</p><p>The two words, translated to English and written in lowercase, without a space are the answer. Turn them into an MD5 hash to get to the next step.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Other than the text on the flag, I had little to go on, except that we are looking at a hilly wooded scene. Google Lens has a nice tool for translating text in an image, but even that was struggling, so I gave in and read a hint:</p><blockquote>\n<p>The flag position changes while the wind blows. Sometimes it blows from one direction, and sometimes it blows from the opposite side.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That was a big help, and I realised that the text might be back to front…</p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img src=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/3/oq24-11-scene-flip.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/3/responsive/oq24-11-scene-flip-xs.jpg 300w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/3/responsive/oq24-11-scene-flip-sm.jpg 480w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/3/responsive/oq24-11-scene-flip-md.jpg 768w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/3/responsive/oq24-11-scene-flip-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure><p>… and finally, I was able to make progress with Google Lens:</p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/3/oq24-12-nachikatsuura.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/3/responsive/oq24-12-nachikatsuura-xs.jpg 300w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/3/responsive/oq24-12-nachikatsuura-sm.jpg 480w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/3/responsive/oq24-12-nachikatsuura-md.jpg 768w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/3/responsive/oq24-12-nachikatsuura-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure><p>Google Maps shows that Nachikatsuura is a pretty large area (about 70 square miles), mostly hilly and wooded! However, we have the flag and a very scenic view, so presumably we are some sort of attraction, and the main attraction in the area is the Kumano Nachi Taisha shrine, a place of pilgramage for at least 800 years. It’s part of the Kumano Kodo UNESCO World Heritage Site and has an amazing waterfall, so there is no shortage of images in Street View.</p><p>This is where the zooming and clicking begins, firstly to try and establish whether the photo was taken at the shrine. Eventually, I stumble across an image that shows a flag in a very similar style to the one in the clue:</p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img src=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/3/oq24-13-flag.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/3/responsive/oq24-13-flag-xs.jpg 300w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/3/responsive/oq24-13-flag-sm.jpg 480w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/3/responsive/oq24-13-flag-md.jpg 768w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/3/responsive/oq24-13-flag-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure><p>I then find a view that confirms we must be in the same place as where the clue photo was taken:</p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/3/oq24-14-match.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/3/responsive/oq24-14-match-xs.jpg 300w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/3/responsive/oq24-14-match-sm.jpg 480w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/3/responsive/oq24-14-match-md.jpg 768w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/3/responsive/oq24-14-match-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure><p>So now I am looking for a snake, and something to do with the ‘year of the snake’, i.e. the Chinese astrological calendar.

This island was the witness of a British steamship being wrecked 130 years ago (the exact day of the anniversary was in September 2024, but what are a few months when you’re talking about more than a hundred years). The story ended well, but it was frightening. I wish that we could spend more of our summer days there. Did you know that a couple of years ago they found a new species of snail on that island?

Here’s the first clue:</p><blockquote>\n<p>Beep! - another email arrived. A bargain sale again, a meeting reminder or maybe this time someone wanted to write to me personally about something more interesting than lower prices, new offers or another time wasting things? I looked at the screen and noticed that the new mail stayed in the Inbox folder. That could mean only two things: either my filters were failing or the message was really meant for me to read. It was the latter this time which made me smile. And when I looked at the Sender’s name, my eyes opened even more. It was an email from my friend, who’s adventures I’ve been tracking a couple of times. My friend didn’t write normal emails, oh no, but liked riddles and non-direct stories. I couldn’t do anything else but to start reading. If you would like to read and follow this adventure with me, here’s the tale:</p><p>And so the adventure ends. We have just arrived at the airport after a long and interesting journey. I took a picture here. They say you never really appreciate the adventure until it’s over. The last flight of this journey went smoothly and lasted exactly as long as it was scheduled. I personally appreciate when the airlines go by the schedule, but this time I had to stop watching a movie I always wanted to see when we were landing, I started watching it as soon as we started the flight and hoped that it would last a few minutes longer, but this time it didn’t and I will have to find out what was the meaning of ‘Rosebud’ later. And I was so close to finding it out on the plane. But this wasn’t the only plot twist during the journey, no! There were more of them. Do you want to hear them? If so, the next story is guarded by the name of the city we were flying from. Can you tell what the name is?</p><p>The password to the next step is the MD5 hash of the abovementioned city name written in lowercase.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To my mind, we first need to find out two things:</p><ul>\n<li>what is the destination airport?</li>\n<li>what is the film referred to, and its running time?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then, using that information, can we work out where the flight originated?</p><p>Starting with the film, most people will know that this is a reference to one of the greatest films of all time: <em>Citizen Kane</em>. This can easily be found to have a running time of just under two hours. </p><p>How about where the flight ended? We get a fairly featureless image as a clue, which I’ve cropped below to make it even more featureless! It does have an unusual word (for an English speaker) and some fairly distinctive design elements in the signs:</p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img src=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/1/oq24-02-airport.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/1/responsive/oq24-02-airport-xs.jpg 300w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/1/responsive/oq24-02-airport-sm.jpg 480w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/1/responsive/oq24-02-airport-md.jpg 768w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/1/responsive/oq24-02-airport-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure><p>Herrer is Danish for ‘Gentlemen’, so now we know our destination is in Denmark. </p><p>Googling <code>airport denmark gate &quot;B8&quot;</code> shows us that the airport is likely Copenhagen (for people new to Google operators, putting ‘B8’ in quotation marks means that it <em>must</em> be included in the result).</p><p>A bit of searching on Google Images reveals that the distinctive visual design does appear at that airport:</p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/1/oq24-03-herrer.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/1/responsive/oq24-03-herrer-xs.jpg 300w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/1/responsive/oq24-03-herrer-sm.jpg 480w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/1/responsive/oq24-03-herrer-md.jpg 768w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/1/responsive/oq24-03-herrer-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure><p>This is quite a busy airport, but The SEINT has left us a couple more clues, in the metadata of the image. It’s unusual to find metadata in images that crop up in real investigations, because social media platforms tend to strip them. But it never hurts to check images you find elsewhere. There are lots of tools around, but since the demise of Jeffrey Friedl’s lovely online tool, I now rely on <strong><a href=\"https://jimpl.com\">Jimpl</a></strong>. It has a pretty clean interface and had no trouble extracting the date and time The SEINT’s friend took their photo:</p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img src=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/1/oq24-04-exif.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/1/responsive/oq24-04-exif-xs.jpg 300w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/1/responsive/oq24-04-exif-sm.jpg 480w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/1/responsive/oq24-04-exif-md.jpg 768w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/1/responsive/oq24-04-exif-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure><p>Copenhagen, like many other airports, has an arrivals checker, but unfortunately it doesn’t go back to last August. However, there’s nothing wrong with <a href=\"https://www.cph.dk/en/flight-information/arrivals?date=29%20%2F%2001%20%2F%202025&time=12\">checking an upcoming Wednesday</a>, in case schedules have stayed the same:</p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/1/oq24-05-arrivals.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/1/responsive/oq24-05-arrivals-xs.jpg 300w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/1/responsive/oq24-05-arrivals-sm.jpg 480w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/1/responsive/oq24-05-arrivals-md.jpg 768w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/1/responsive/oq24-05-arrivals-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure><p>There are a couple of cities here that could fit the bill for a flight of under two hours, so in the end I had to settle for a bit of trial and error. It took a few attempts, but I eventually plugged <code>paris</code> into CyberChef and unlocked <a href=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/hotelrooms-and-other-strange-places-2024-2.html\">Step 2</a>!</p>",
