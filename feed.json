A bargain sale again, a meeting reminder or maybe this time someone wanted to write to me personally about something more interesting than lower prices, new offers or another time wasting things? I looked at the screen and noticed that the new mail stayed in the Inbox folder. That could mean only two things: either my filters were failing or the message was really meant for me to read. It was the latter this time which made me smile. And when I looked at the Sender’s name, my eyes opened even more. It was an email from my friend, who’s adventures I’ve been tracking a couple of times. My friend didn’t write normal emails, oh no, but liked riddles and non-direct stories. I couldn’t do anything else but to start reading. If you would like to read and follow this adventure with me, here’s the tale:</p><p>And so the adventure ends. We have just arrived at the airport after a long and interesting journey. I took a picture here. They say you never really appreciate the adventure until it’s over. The last flight of this journey went smoothly and lasted exactly as long as it was scheduled. I personally appreciate when the airlines go by the schedule, but this time I had to stop watching a movie I always wanted to see when we were landing, I started watching it as soon as we started the flight and hoped that it would last a few minutes longer, but this time it didn’t and I will have to find out what was the meaning of ‘Rosebud’ later. And I was so close to finding it out on the plane. But this wasn’t the only plot twist during the journey, no! There were more of them. Do you want to hear them? If so, the next story is guarded by the name of the city we were flying from. Can you tell what the name is?</p><p>The password to the next step is the MD5 hash of the abovementioned city name written in lowercase.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Okay, so the film that references Rosebud is said by many to be the greatest of all time: Citizen Kane. This has a running time of just under two hours, so we are looking for a flight a few minutes under two hours, maybe 1:55?</p><p>So we know the flight’s duration, and have a picture of where it ended:</p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/1/oq24-02-airport.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/1/responsive/oq24-02-airport-xs.jpg 300w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/1/responsive/oq24-02-airport-sm.jpg 480w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/1/responsive/oq24-02-airport-md.jpg 768w ,https://jules-lewis.github.io/blog/media/posts/1/responsive/oq24-02-airport-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure><p>Herrer is Danish for ‘Gentlemen’, so now we know our destination is in Denmark. </p><p>Googling <code>airport denmark gate &quot;B8&quot;</code> shows us that the airport is likely Copenhagen (for people new to Google operators, putting ‘B8’ in quotation marks means that it <em>must</em> be included in the result).</p>",
